# Hand-Written-Recognition

Recognition is identifying or distinguishing a thing or an individual from the past experiences
or learning. Similarly, Digit Recognition is nothing but recognizing or identifying the digits
in any document. Digit recognition framework is simply the working of a machine to prepare
itself or interpret the digits. Handwritten Digit Recognition is the capacity of a computer to
interpret the manually written digits from various sources like messages, bank cheques,
papers, pictures, and so forth and in various situations for web based handwriting recognition
on PC tablets, identifying number plates of vehicles, handling bank cheques, digits entered
in any forms etc.
Handwriting recognition of characters has been around since the 1980s. The task of
handwritten digit recognition, using a classifier, has extraordinary significance and use such
as – online digit recognition on PC tablets, recognize zip codes on mail, processing bank
check amounts, numeric sections in structures filled up by hand (for example ‐ tax forms)
and so on. There are diverse challenges faced while attempting to solve this problem. The
handwritten digits are not always of the same size, thickness, or orientation and position
relative to the margins. The main objective was to actualize a pattern characterization method
to perceive the handwritten digits provided in the MINIST data set of images of handwritten
digits (0‐9).



As a Final Year Project(Mini project) , Me and My Team  Developed a GUI(Tkinter) that recognizes Handwritten Digits using Deep Learning(CNN) with the help of the MNIST Dataset which is able to give accuracy of about 98.72%.
